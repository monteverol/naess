                  Our Beginning
                </h4>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  NAESS SHIPPING PHILIPPINES, INC. was born on October 24, 1980 with the signing of the documents by Capt. Pablo Gutierrez and Mr. Arturo Piree at the Army Navy Club in Manila. Our first office had a staff of merely five employees at the mezzanine of the Pennville Building on Leon Guinto Street, Malate, Upon approval and registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December of the same year, initial manning operations began with a modest number of 25 vessels. Within three years, we were able to acquire and transfer to our own office at 2215 Leon Guinto St., Malate.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Barely a decade of operations found NAESS SHIPPING PHILIPPINES, INC. in the service of eight principals, reaching the 100-mark of enrolled vessels with the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA)â€”a positive confirmation and sure sign of the Shipping Industry's acceptance and approval of our manning services. With business at its peak, on the first week of October 1991, the property we had acquired and held office in since 1983 was reconstructed into the 4-storey building that presently stands on Leon Guinto today.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Like everyone in the industry, we had our share of uphill struggles when we awoke one morning and found the Philippine economy in utter chaos. Affected by the currency crisis and other factors, adjustments had to be made. Thanks to the confidence of the international shipping industry in our integrity and quality service, recovery was just a matter of time. Despite temporary setbacks, NSP continued to enjoy its world-class distinction as one of the best manning agencies in the country.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  In keeping with the rapid changes in technology, we implemented our computerization program as far back as 1984. Now, we have integrated our database with our web site to enable our principals to view on-line and download anytime all important documents and certificates relevant to our seafarers on board their vessels. We also boast of being certified by Det Norske Veritas in the ISO 9001-2000 Series Quality Standard with the Quality System Certificate and the Crew Manning Certificate.
