                NAESS SHIPPING PHILIPPINES, INC. was born on October 24, 1980 with the signing of the documents by Capt. Pablo Gutierrez and Mr. Arturo Piree at the Army Navy Club in Manila. Our first office had a staff of merely five employees at the mezzanine of the Pennville Building on Leon Guinto Street, Malate, Upon approval and registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December of the same year, initial manning operations began with a modest number of 25 vessels. Within three years, we were able to acquire and transfer to our own office at 2215 Leon Guinto St., Malate.

                Barely a decade of operations found NAESS SHIPPING PHILIPPINES, INC.in the service of eight principals, reaching the 100-mark of enrolled vessels with the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration ( POEA )-a positive confirmation and sure sign of the Shipping Industryâ€™s acceptance and approval of our manning services. With business at its peak, on the first week of October 1991, the property we had acquired and held office in since 1983 was reconstructed into the 4-storey building that presently stands on Leon Guinto today.
